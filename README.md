This repository exists to store the archived copy of "Paths in strange spaces", a blog post I wrote that -- for reasons that escape me -- has been cited in more substantial scholarly works. As the blog in question no longer exists, I've reposted it as a preprint on psyarxiv in order to preserve the citation trail if -- again, for reasons that escape me -- someone ever feels the need to track it down. 

Navarro, D. (2020, September 23). Paths in strange spaces: A comment on preregistration. https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/wxn58

The post itself is not particularly interesting, quite frankly, but I do think there's value in making sure archival copies exist.
